        a king on c3 and a pawn on d3.\\n- Black has a king on d5.\\n\\nIt's White's
        turn to move. The goal is to promote the pawn while keeping the king safe
        from being captured.\\n\\n### Step-by-step reasoning:\\n\\n1. **Identify the
        Threats**: The black king on d5 is currently blocking the pawn on d3 from
        advancing. The black king can move to c4 or e4 on the next turn, but it cannot
        capture the white king on c3.\\n\\n2. **White's Options**: \\n   - The white
        king can move to c4 or b4. \\n   - The pawn can move to d4, but that would
        not be a good move since the black king can then capture it on the next turn.\\n\\n3.
        **Best Move**: \\n   - Moving the white king to c4 (Kc4) is a strong move
        because it directly supports the pawn on d3 and also blocks the black king
        from advancing to c4 or e4. \\n   - This move also keeps the white king close
        to the pawn, allowing for a potential promotion in the next few moves.\\n\\n###
        Conclusion:\\nThe best move for White is to move the king to c4.\\n\\nFinal

        and also restricts the black king's movement.\\n   - Moving the king to c3
