        Position**:\\n   - The board is empty except for the two kings and a pawn.\\n
        \  - White has a king on `d3` (3K) and a pawn on `d2` (3P).\\n   - Black has
        a king on `d5` (3k).\\n   - It's White's turn to move.\\n\\n2. **Objective**:\\n
        \  - The goal is to promote the pawn while keeping the black king from stopping
        it.\\n   - The white king is well-placed to support the pawn's advance.\\n\\n3.
        **Possible Moves**:\\n   - The white king can move to `c4` (Kc4) or `e4` (Ke4).\\n
        \  - The pawn can move to `d3` (Pd3).\\n\\n4. **Evaluating Moves**:\\n   -
        **Kc4**: This move places the white king on `c4`, which is one square away
        from the black king. The black king can then move to `c5` or `e5`, but it
        does not directly threaten the pawn.\\n   - **Ke4**: This move places the
        white king on `e4`, which is further away from the black king and does not
        directly support the pawn's advance.\\n   - **Pd3**: This move advances the
        pawn to `d3`, which is a strong move because it threatens to promote on the
        next turn. The black king cannot capture the pawn on `d3` because it is protected
        by the white king on `d3`.\\n\\n5. **Best Move**:\\n   - The best move is
        to advance the pawn to `d3` (Pd3). This move puts the pawn one step away from
        promotion and keeps the black king from being able to capture it.\\n\\nFinal

        The goal for White is to promote the pawn on d4 to a queen or another piece,
        while also ensuring the king can support the pawn's advance.\\n\\n2. **Legal
        moves for White**: \\n   - The White king can move to c4 (Kc4) or e4 (Ke4).\\n
        \  - The pawn can move to d5 (d5).\\n\\n3. **Evaluate the moves**:\\n   -
        **Kc4**: This move places the king on c4, which is a good position to support
        the pawn. However, it does not advance the pawn.\\n   - **Ke4**: This move
        places the king on e4, which is also a good position but does not advance
        the pawn.\\n   - **d5**: This move advances the pawn to d5, which is a strong
        move because it threatens to promote on the next turn unless Black captures
        it.\\n\\n4. **Consider Black's response**: \\n   - If White plays d5, Black
        must respond. The only legal move for Black would be to capture the pawn with
        Kxd5. \\n   - After that, White can move the king to d3 (Kd3) to continue
        supporting the pawn.\\n\\n5. **Conclusion**: The strongest move for White

        The goal is to promote the pawn while keeping the king safe.\\n\\n1. The first
        thing to consider is the position of the kings. The White king on c3 is in
        a good position to support the pawn on d3.\\n2. The Black king on d5 is directly
        in front of the pawn, which means it can block the pawn's advance if White
        does not move the king to support it.\\n3. The best move for White is to move
        the king closer to the pawn to support its advance.\\n\\nThe only legal move
        that achieves this is to move the White king to d4. This move puts the White
        king directly in front of the Black king, allowing the pawn to advance on
